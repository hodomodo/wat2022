<h1>Fundamentals of HTML</h1>

<h2>Text Formatting</h2>

<body>

<p>A paragraph with some <em>words that are empahsized </em>and <b>some important words. </b>Followed by some <mark>highlighted</mark></p>

<tbody>This is some text</tbody>
<tbody>that is laid out exactly as</tbody>
<tbody>Laid out at code level without any additional</tbody>
<tbody>markup</tbody>

<h2>Special Characters</h2>

<p>The browser thinks < is a programming character. Also >. The browser also ignores any link breaks<br>in your code and any &nbsp &#160 white space. To include these you need to use special characters aka html characte entries. There are other entities available such as Â£ and &#38;</br></p>

<h2>Links</h2>
<p>A web page without any links is a unique perculiar find. You can have links to seperate sites such as <a href="">Leeds Beckett</a>. Links to other pages of the <a href="">same site.</a> Links to another point in the <a href="">same page</a></p>

<h2>Images</h2>

<p>This image is stored on this server in an image sub-folder</p>
<p>I hope you added an alt attribute to support screeen readers<p>
<p>Why not check to see what happens if you try to validate your code using W3C Markup Validation Service without the alt attribute included. If you right click on your page and choose inspect or view source you can check your code and see the HTML comment you have added just inside the body tag


<p>Notes:</p>
<li>The final para is automatically word wrapped by the browser and does not contain a line break</li>
<li>The image has been prepared as small 100x100 image prior to inclusion on the page</li>
<li>To create a link to another page simple second page will be needed - put a return link on that page</li>
<li>To test the intrapage link you will probably need to resize the browser so that only a narrow vertical window is open</li>
