    <h1>Fundamentals of CSS</h1>
    <h3>Cascading</h3>
    <p style="font-weight:800">
        Style can be added as an inline element using the style attribute on tags as in the case for this paragraph.
        Here font-weight has been given a weight of 800.</font-weight:>
    </p>
    <pre style="color: green">
     The inline style takes precedent over all other style
     declarations. Next in order of precedent is the embeded
     style. This uses style tags and is ofter found in the
     header section of a page. This pre tag is styled with
     embedded style. An extra large green font.
    </pre>
    <p>Ideally style is held seperate to structure in a style sheet. Other than the 2 examples above all other style on this page is in a seperate style sheet. Including the change of base font to Arial.</p>


    <h3 id="Selector">Selectors</h3>
    <p>
        CSS selectors are used to apply style. There is the element selector, class selector and id selector.
        All being well you have used an element selector to mofity the font on this page by adding style to the body tag in your attached style sheet.
        Words in this <span class="sentence">sentence</span>have been <span class="sentence">styled</span> using a class selector apllied to letter spacing and the heading for this section with an id selector.
    </p>
