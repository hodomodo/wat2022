<h1>Fundamentals of HTML</h1>


<h3>Text Formatting</h3>

<body>

    <p>A paragraph with some <em>words that are empahsized </em>and <b>some important words. </b>Followed by some <mark>highlighted words</mark>. Feel free to add any other text formattig that appeals to you.</p>
    <pre>
     This is some Text
     that is laid out exactly as
     laid out at code level without any additional
     markup
    </pre>

    <h3>Special Characters</h3>

    <p>The browser thinks < is a programming character. Also >. The browser also ignores any line breaks</p>

    <h3>Links</h3>
    <p>A web page without any links is a unique and peculiar find. You can have links to seperate sites such as <a href="https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/">Leeds Beckett.</a> Links to other pages of the <a href="https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/undergraduate/applying-to-university/">same site.</a> Links to another point in the <a id="location" href="">same page</a>.</p>

    <h3>Images</h3>
    <img src="C:\Users\HODOM\Documents\University\Year 2\Term 1\Web Applications\wat2022\Images\Scotch.png" alt="scotch wallpaper" style="width:50%;height:30%">
    <p>This image is stored on this server in an image sub-folder</p>
    <p>I hope you added an alt attribute to support screen readers</p>
    <p>
       Why not check to see what happens if you try to validate your code using the W3C Markup Validation Service 
       without the alt attribute included. If you right click on your page and choose inpect or view sourceyou can 
       check your code and see the HTML comment you have added just inside the body tag
    </p>
